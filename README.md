# Python Projects Showcase

A collection of Python scripts and projects covering various areas including web development, machine learning, and data visualization.

## Core Technologies

This project utilizes several Python libraries and frameworks, including but not limited to:

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Keras
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- pip (Python package installer): Usually comes with Python.
- virtualenv (recommended for managing project-specific dependencies): Install using pip:
  ```sh
  pip install virtualenv
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```sh
   git clone <Repository-URL>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory.
   ```sh
   cd python
   ```

## Usage

Each script or sub-project in this repository serves a different purpose. Navigate to the specific directory of interest (e.g., `src/machine_learning/Keras/HandDrawnDigits/`) and refer to any specific instructions or comments within the Python files for usage.

For the Flask web application (`src/webapp/`), once running, open your web browser and navigate to the local address provided by Flask (usually `http://120.0.0.1:5000/`).

## Built With

This repository contains a variety of scripts and projects. Some notable technologies used include:

- Python - The primary programming language.
